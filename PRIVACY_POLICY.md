*Last updated: August 5, 2025*

## Overview

Pomodoro Buddy ("the App") is designed with privacy as a core principle. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our productivity timer application.

## Information We Collect

**We collect NO personal information.**

Pomodoro Buddy operates entirely on your local device and does not:
- Collect personal data

## Data Storage

All data generated by Pomodoro Buddy is stored locally on your device, including:
- Timer preferences (session lengths, notification settings)
- Work session statistics and history
- Keyboard shortcut preferences
- Application settings

This data remains on your device and is never transmitted anywhere.

## Permissions

Pomodoro Buddy requests minimal system permissions:

### Notifications
- **Purpose**: To alert you when work sessions and breaks are complete

## App Sandbox

Pomodoro Buddy runs in Apple's App Sandbox, which:
- Restricts the app's access to your system
- Prevents unauthorized data access
- Ensures the app can only access what it needs to function
- Provides additional security protections

## Third-Party Services

We do not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## Data Sharing

Since we don't collect any data, we have nothing to share. Pomodoro Buddy:
- Does not share data with third parties
- Does not sell user information
- Does not provide data to advertisers
- Does not use analytics or tracking services

## Children's Privacy

Pomodoro Buddy is safe for users of all ages. Since we collect no personal information, there are no special privacy concerns for children under 13.

## Data Security

Your locally stored preferences are protected by:
- macOS security features
- App Sandbox restrictions
- Standard file system permissions
- No network transmission of data

## Your Rights and Controls

You have complete control over your data:
- **Access**: All data is stored in standard macOS locations accessible to you

## Changes to This Policy

If we ever change how we handle data (which would require a major app redesign), we will:
